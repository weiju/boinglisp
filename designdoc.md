* Design documentation

After some experimentation, the decision was made to write the runtime
system in C, for better maintenance and portability. It is simply too much
effort to write it in assembly.

However, the code generated by the compiler will still be in assembly,
for the sake of learning and better control of continuations.

It follows that we need to make sure we understand how to integrate assembly
code for VASM and C code generated by VBCC.

The stack layout for a C function call is as follows:

    ------------------
    | Return address |
    ------------------
    | Argument 1     |
    ------------------
    | Argument 2     |
    ------------------
    | ...            |
    ------------------

C functions will in general return the result in Register d0, unless it is
a struct where depending on the size, the result either ends up in the data
registers or in the stack.
