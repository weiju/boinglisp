# Chibi Lisp

## Description

This is a small, portable Lisp interpreter written in Racket
bootstrap a compiler on any platform, with a special configuration
for Amiga support.

The language set supported is a subset of Scheme, sufficient to
run the examples in "Little Schemer" and to write a compiler to
generate machine code for a target architecture.
